1. instructor / helpers / course introduction
1. introduction to Chapel (download the [PDF slides](http://bit.ly/chapeltop))

1. let's try loading single-locale Chapel and compiling a simple code
1. let's write a makefile for compiling Chapel codes

Start with the **Basic language features** page. Next go to **Task parallelism** and try to go as far as you can in that
page before the mid-day session. I suggest skipping *"Parallelizing the heat transfer equation"* subsection at the end
to save time.

Try to do all exercises in the lessons. The solutions are posted at the end of each page: please try not to look at them
while working on the problems.
