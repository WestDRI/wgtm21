1. Instructor / helpers / course introduction
1. Introduction to Chapel (download the [PDF slides](http://bit.ly/chapeltop))
1. Distribute usernames and passwords
1. Hands-on on the cluster:  
  4.1 let's try to log in to the training cluster  
  4.2 let's try loading single-locale Chapel and compiling a simple code  
  4.3 let's write a makefile for compiling Chapel codes  
  4.4 let's submit a serial job script to run Chapel on a compute node
1. Review the program for self-study:  
  5.1 build step-by-step a serial heat diffusion solver  
  5.2 task parallelism in shared-memory

Start with the **Basic language features** page. Next go to **Task parallelism** and try to go as far as you can in that
page before the mid-day session. I suggest skipping *"Parallelizing the heat transfer equation"* subsection at the end
to save time.

Try to do all exercises in the lessons. The solutions are posted at the end of each page: please try not to look at them
while working on the problems.
