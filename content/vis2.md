1. run some exercises from this morning
1. answer any questions
1. review the program for the afternoon, share the afternoon exercises

You have **1h30m** of videos to watch this afternoon!

Do not try to run remote visualization demos on Cassiopeia training cluster: it is not powerful enough to do any CPU
rendering (virtual CPUs), and it does not have GPUs. If you have a Compute Canada account, you can try a small-scale
client-server visualization on Cedar, and a large-scale remote visualization only if you feel ambitious.

For practice , I suggest focusing on GUI animation and scripting.
