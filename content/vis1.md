1. instructor / helpers / course introduction
1. slides for this course
1. let's try to start ParaView on your computer
1. review the program for this morning: you have **1h43m** of videos to watch!
    - simple 1D/2D plotting with Matplotlib (covered in the Python course) and Plotly (notes linked from this course)
	- today's focus is 3D visualization with ParaView
1. pay attention to the slides that say *"Exercise"* in the title -- we'll do these in the Zoom session

<!-- Plotly is a **side topic** to show some simple interactive plotting where ParaView is an overkill. Please do not spend -->
<!-- more than 30 mins on it, or you will have no time left for 3D visualization! On the other hand, if all you are -->
<!-- interested is 1D/2D plotting then feel free to spend more time on Plotly. -->

By mid-day you should be comfortable with:

* running ParaView and displaying Source objects
* importing datasets from files into ParaView
* applying filters to process data

If you have yor own spatially-defined dataset, try loading it into ParaView and sharing your experience (or
visualizations!) in the mid-day session.

<!-- - creating and deleting files and directories, copying and moving them -->
<!-- - writing text into a file and printing its contents to the terminal -->
<!-- - working with `tar` archives -->
