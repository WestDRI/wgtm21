<!-- 9-10 am Pacific Live Intro session -->
<!-- 10-1 pm Pacific Self learning (video and exercises) -->
<!-- 1-2:30 pm Pacific Live QA session -->

During this self-paced, hands-on workshop, you will be introduced to parallel and GPU computing in MATLAB for speeding
up your application and offloading computations. By working through common scenarios and workflows, you will gain an
understanding of the parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the issues that may arise when using
them.

**Agenda**:

- Speeding up programs with parallel computing
- Working with large data sets
- GPU computing
- Scaling to Compute Canada HPC cluster

**Instructor**: Raymond Norris (MathWorks)

**Prerequisites**:

- working knowledge of MATLAB,
- a [supported browser](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/browser-requirements.html),
- a MathWorks account (if you don't already have one please go [here](https://www.mathworks.com/login) to create one), and
- working knowledge of the Linux Bash shell and familiarity with Compute Canada's HPC cluster environment, in
  particular, with the Slurm scheduler (covered in [our HPC course](../basics_hpc)).

**Software**: We'll be running MATLAB in a browser.

**Resources**:

<!-- - [Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/H8KM487zNrk) -->
- [MATLAB workshop material](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/8bd444df-1344-429e-aa71-1da85bf81870)
- [MATLAB Classroom](https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/PC_3507600) - valid only for the day of the workshop
- PDF slides for [the morning session](../../slides/MATLAB-parallelComputing1.pdf) and
  [the afternoon session](../../slides/MATLAB-parallelComputing2.pdf)

<!-- All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed -->
<!-- on their computer in order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend -->
<!-- [the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers SSH is -->
<!-- usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there). -->
