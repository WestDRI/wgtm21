#### Registration

We provide registration links from each module's page (accessible from the top menu or from [the front page](../)).

Please register for any module in which you would like to attend a course. Once you register for a module, you can
attend any course(s) in it. We will email a Zoom link to all registered participants before the start of each module.

We recommend that you register only for the modules that you would like to attend.

##### Important: your email address

These training modules are open to anyone associated with a Canadian post-secondary academic institution. When
registering, please provide your Canadian institutional email address. If you specify a gmail / yahoo / hotmail / other
non-academic email address, we will cancel your registration.
